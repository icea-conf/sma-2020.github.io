                    <li class="li-style"><p style="text-align: justify">An open-ended process continues to invent, discover and innovate forever.  Ideally, the artifacts of such a process also become increasingly complex and interesting over time.  While open-endedness is certainly an aspect of human intelligence, featuring prominently in traits like creativity and invention, it is also evident in nature outside any form of conventional intelligence, such as in the evolution of life on Earth.  In this way, open-endedness is both an essential property we hope to achieve in AI, but also an aspect of our reality that goes beyond AI as it emerges in natural processes.  In fact, just as our intelligence is a product of evolution on Earth - an open-ended process - so might such a process ultimately be necessary to achieve strong AI.</p></li>

                    <li class="li-style"><p style="text-align: justify">Kenneth O. Stanley leads a research team at OpenAI on the challenge of open-endedness. He was previously Charles Millican Professor of Computer Science at the University of Central Florida and was also a co-founder of Geometric Intelligence Inc., which was acquired by Uber to create Uber AI Labs, where he was head of Core AI research.  He received a B.S.E. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1997 and received a Ph.D. in 2004 from the University of Texas at Austin.  He is an inventor of the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), HyperNEAT, novelty search, and POET algorithms, as well as the CPPN representation, among many others.  His main research contributions are in neuroevolution (i.e. evolving neural networks), generative and developmental systems, coevolution, machine learning for video games, interactive evolution, quality diversity, and open-endedness. He has won best paper awards for his work on NEAT, NERO, NEAT Drummer, FSMC, HyperNEAT, novelty search, Galactic Arms Race, POET, and MCC. His original 2002 paper on NEAT also received the 2017 ISAL Award for Outstanding Paper of the Decade 2002 - 2012 from the International Society for Artificial Life. He is a coauthor of the popular science book, "Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective" (published by Springer), and has spoken widely on its subject.</p></li>

                    <b>Abstract</b>
                    <li class="li-style"><p style="text-align: justify">Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology that controls external devices such as robot arms and robot legs by converting brain signals into computer commands. This technology, along with artificial intelligence (AI), is considered future technologies that will lead the fourth industrial revolution. Recently, global AI companies such as Facebook and Tesla have been developing technologies to commercialize BCI technology based on a large amount of capital and there is a growing interest in BCIs worldwide. In this talk, I will introduce a fundamental concept and the principle of BCI, along with the recent advances in BCI research at Korea University such as exoskeleton robot control, wheelchair control, and neuro-driving based on BCI. Additionally, we are performing various research, utilizing BCI technology, to detect the levels of consciousness for anesthesia and sleep, and to develop intuitive communication based on imagined speech. Also, we developed various machine learning techniques to increase the accuracy of classifying the user’s intentions. The BCI can be directly used for efficient rehabilitation training as well as daily assistance for patients with physical discomfort, and can also be used as a technology to improve human intelligence as the next-generation interface. Detailed techniques and applications will be discussed in the talk.</p></li>
